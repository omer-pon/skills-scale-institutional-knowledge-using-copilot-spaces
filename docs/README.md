# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

Based on the documentation in the docs folder, OctoAcme's project management processes are designed to streamline the delivery of cross-functional projects, emphasizing clear ownership, iterative development, and data-driven decision-making. The workflow begins with project initiation, where a business need is validated through a Project One-pager, stakeholder alignment, and a high-level plan. Planning then breaks down deliverables into actionable backlogs, defines acceptance criteria, and identifies dependencies and risks, ensuring that every project transitions smoothly from concept to execution with well-documented milestones and responsibilities.

Core roles and personas are distinctly defined to foster accountability and collaboration. The Project Manager (PM) coordinates delivery, risk management, and communications, while the Product Manager (PdM) shapes product vision and prioritizes outcomes. Developers implement features, maintain code quality, and participate in design and review. The Scrum Master facilitates agile practices and removes impediments. UX Designers ensure intuitive user experiences through research and design. DevOps Engineers enable reliable deployments and maintain system observability. Customer Success Managers gather feedback and ensure customer satisfaction. Security Leads embed security throughout the development lifecycle. These roles are supported by comprehensive templates, checklists, and collaboration frameworks that clarify responsibilities, streamline onboarding, and ensure effective cross-functional coordination.

Communication is structured to maintain transparency and alignment. Weekly syncs between PM and PdM, frequent team standups, and regular stakeholder updates create predictable touchpoints for sharing status, addressing risks, and making decisions. Incident and risk communication follow established templates and escalation paths, ensuring that issues are surfaced and resolved promptly. Retrospectives after sprints or milestones foster continuous improvement by capturing lessons learned and translating them into actionable changes tracked in the project backlog.

Quality assurance is built into every stage of the process. Automated unit, integration, and end-to-end testing are required for new code, alongside manual QA for feature acceptance when needed. CI pipelines enforce test and lint standards prior to code review and merging, while deployment and release are governed by rigorous checklists, rollback plans, and post-release verification. Metrics such as velocity, burndown, and success signals are monitored via dashboards, and risks are managed through a living register reviewed at regular intervals. This integrated approach ensures that OctoAcme projects are delivered reliably, with minimal surprises and a strong focus on continuous improvement.
